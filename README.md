# superbowl

To spice-up the Feb 2025 superbowl party I am hosting, let's have a betting pool on the outcomes and allow friends at the party to submit their bets. Winner gets bragging rights for being a fortune teller.

Bet submission:
- Who will win the match?
- What will the score be?
- How many AI ads will we see?
- Will Travis Kelce propose to Taylor Swift?

Leaderboard:
- Name, answers, score

Scoring:
- To score, we enter the final outcomes in the admin page and then calculate what the scores each person got on the leaderboard
